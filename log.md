# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Installed VM, VS, Ruby and  completed first rails app exercise

**Thoughts:** Hard slog today getting set up following The Odin Project guide.  At the start of a big learning curve but enjoying the challenge.  Managed some troubleshooting when I created the repo with a readme and the git push failed.  Figured it out so that's a win !
